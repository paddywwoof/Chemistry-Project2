Aim:
To Fully determine the chemical structure of a molecule
based on NMR Data


Reading NMR Data from file:
	Reading NMR Types:
		1D H1 and H13 NMR Spectra
			Input Carbon Peak Data and Hydrogen Integration Data
			 # Example of each goes here
		2D COSY, HSQC, HMBC
		
		Integration Data from Hydrogen Spectrum determines the number of hydrogens
		represented by that peak
		
		Generate a list of 1D Signals with shift value, signal type (C or H)
		and multiplicity
		
		2D Signal Manager reads all 2D data and finds the corresponding 1D signals that it is closest to,
			and generates a 2D Signal corresponding to this peak.
			If the peak differs from any 1D peak in either coordinate by a specified error value, then it is ignored
			In the case of the COSY spectra, asymmetric peaks are also removed
		
		The 2D Signal Manager then creates an NxN Interaction Matrix of all the interaction types
		with a row/column for each atom (i.e. signals with multiplicities > 1 will have multiple equivalent adjacent rows/columns)
		
			[
			1:COSY
			2:HSQC
			3:HMBC
			]
						
		INADEQUATE interactions are then inferred using the method shown below:
			#INSERT DIAGRAM HERE
	
				
		Infer bonds using HMBC by focusing only on the 3-bond HMBC interactions
		
Interaction Manager:
	Interaction Manager takes the interaction manager, a list of the atom types and their shift values
	
	Determines immediately obvious bonds,
		HSQC implies H-C bonds,
		INAD implies C-C and C=C bonds
		
		
Minimiser:
	Takes the Interaction Manager and uses the data to create fragments
	of the molecule representing chains of bonded atoms
	
	HMBC then infers inter-fragment bonds in the following manner:
		Since HMBC usually represents 2/3 bond interactions try and form only 3-bond interactions
			consider each HMBC interaction [HW,CZ]and check if is already satisfied
			then check whether the valency of the carbon adjacent (CX) to HW is fully satisfied (eliminating the possibility of 2-bond interactions)
			if there is only one carbon adjacent to CX with incomplete valency (CY) then
